#summary The steps for a head-to-head test against boost::asio
#labels testing

= Introduction =

Today I have just found out what was the problem with solidground/examples/extern/boost/asio/proxyserver.cpp which led to poor performance on Linux.
I have found out that, the sockets, although used asynchronously, they were blocking. All was needed was to make them non blocking:

{{{
    tcp::socket::non_blocking_io non_blocking_io(true);
    socket_.io_control(non_blocking_io);
}}}

That nasty problem prevented me to do a head to head performance comparison with boost::asio.

= Setting up the test environment =

Of course I've immediately set up the test environment (a Fedora 13 machine on a AMD3000+ x64):
 * Programs involved: solidground/examples/client/alphaclient_p, solidground/examples/foundation/main/concept and solidground/examples/extern/boost/asio/proxyserver.
  * The scenario: on the same machine start the servers in three different consoles: "./concept", "./concept -b 2000", "./proxyserver 3115 localhost 1114". The first concept instance is for file serving on concept::alpha protocol. The second one is for it's proxy service. The first concept sever, serves 10 files with sizes from 4KB to 8.8MB.
  * The test: I used alphaclient_p with 50 threads, testing head to head solidground proxy with boost proxy. Every thread do:
    * request the list of files (alpha LIST command)
    * fetches every file in the list two times (alpha FETCH command).

There is alphaclient_p call for solidground proxy:
{{{
time ./alphaclient_p 50 localhost 2115 ~/tmp/00000001 1 2 "" 1114
}}}

and the call for boost proxy:
{{{
time ./alphaclient_p 50 localhost 3115 ~/tmp/00000001 1 2
}}}
