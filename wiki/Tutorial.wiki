#summary A step by step tutorial for start using SolidGround.

= Introduction =

Below I will present the steps you'll need to do to write your own SolidGround based application. Although in the beginning I will present how to setup the working space within the solidground/applications directory the rest of the text will present the proof of concept server from test/clientserver.

= Preparing the environment =

SolidGround (SG) is a framework which is also designed as a workspace. This means that your application should integrate into the SG's build system. I don't know if this is a good idea, but I believe it allows someone to easily start writing SG based code.

First of all you'll need to get a copy of the SG repository. See [
http://code.google.com/p/solidground/wiki/Introduction] (How to build and test the proof of concept server) wiki-page for the steps you need to do to build the SG's test applications.
