#summary Release log

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

This is main release log for SolidFrame.

= 0.9.977 =

Main changes:
  * IPC: Add support for authenticating the ipc sessions.
  * IPC: Find a better way to disconnect after a failed authentication
  * IPC: Add support for sending authentication commands while in authenticating state. Commands with AuthenticationFlag? set.(NEEDS proper testing!!!!)
  * IPC: Check that a failed authentication, raises the objects waiting for commands to be sent.
  * IPC: Add support for compressing buffers.
  * IPC/Serialization: One should be able to register the same structure/class multiple times, every time being constructed on creation with a different constructor. Also we need to be able to specify the position on which the map will be registered.
  * Serialization: add support for specific objects
  * Serialization: Improve binary serialization performance and create better test applications.
  * Serialization: Add support for pushUtf8(std::string&) to binary::serialization - the string will be serialized as null terminated data, i.e. no size.
  * Serialization: Add support for limits to binary::serialization. Add the following methods and changes to both serializer and deserializer:
     # constructor(const Limits `*`pdefaultlimits);
     # resetLimits(); //reset all limits to default
     # pushStringLimit(uint32(256)) / pushStringLimit(), reset to default.
     # pushStreamLimit(uint64(200000000)) / pushStreamLimit(), reset to default.
     # pushContainerLimit(uint32()) - pushContainerLimit(), reset to default.

  * Foundation: Try to optimize the memory usage for foundation::Object, related to the signal queue, by moving the queue onto the foundation::Service.
  * System: Optimize specific memory cache by dropping usage of queues and using a simple linked list.
  * Find a fix for thread safe static member within static function.
